Robotics Node : This code snippet is part of an ongoing project, serving as a demonstration to showcase my coding proficiency. Here, I'm constructing a real-time vision system inegrated in a robotics node,
which is crucial for the project's functionality.the nitty gritty details in the code are private. 

Yolov4_archt : here i build the yolov4 architecture , CSPDARKNET53 as backbone , PAnet as Neck , and the classic yolo head with anchors , yolov4 uses 608 img size but using conv2d instead of fc layers makes it flexible to use any size . architecture : https://pub.mdpi-res.com/sensors/sensors-23-03385/article_deploy/html/images/sensors-23-03385-g001.png?1679563307
